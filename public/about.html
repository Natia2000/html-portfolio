    <p style= "text-align: justify;">My leadership  journey began, when I decided to do all my best for improvement psychological conditions in my country, I needed fundamentally  learning my profession fields in order to refine my capacities and get to know well people in different regions in Georgia. Because of this reason I was actively participating in social or volunteer activities for deciding local problems and find ways for solving essential questions. In 2013, I graduated from Chokhatauri Municipality School, which marked the beginning of my academic pursuits. Subsequently, I embarked on a remarkable educational journey at Tbilisi State University. I received a master degree in clinical art-therapy in Caucasus University.Furthermore, because of my activity and achievements I was supposed to work in Imereti region with children who were victims of different kinds of violence.  Through my regional clinical psychologistâ€™ role with the Social Service Agency and The State Care Agency I was engaging in psychological evaluations and examination during family dispute procedures, crisis intervention, in the juvenile justice process, psychological counseling, and psycho-education for these vulnerable individuals. During about three years practice in this position I managed more than 200 children cases and was empowering their parents. I was translating and sharing special information because of lack of forensic psychological professional literature and researches in Georgia. I have an active clinical practice in psychological field,I implement projects and conduct thherapy with children and adolescents.</p>
